# Employee Exit Surveys Python Data Analysis Project
Clean and Analyze Employee Exit Surveys with Python
## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: [Ask](https://github.com/Romeeeo/Employee_exit_surveys/edit/main/README.md#ask), [Prepare](https://github.com/Romeeeo/Employee_exit_surveys/edit/main/README.md#prepare), [Process](https://github.com/Romeeeo/Employee_exit_surveys/edit/main/README.md#process), [Analyze](https://github.com/Romeeeo/Employee_exit_surveys/edit/main/README.md#analyze-and-share), [Share](https://github.com/Romeeeo/Employee_exit_surveys/edit/main/README.md#analyze-and-share), and [Act](https://github.com/Romeeeo/Employee_exit_surveys/edit/main/README.md#act).
## Background

### Scenario
We will play the role of the Data Analysis and provide insights to our stakeholders. In this project we will work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the DETE exit survey data [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey). The original TAFE exit survey data is no longer available. We've made some slight modifications to the original datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)

## Ask
### Business Task
Figure out reason as to why employees are leaving
### Analysis Questions
Two questions that the stakeholders would like to know will guide us:  
1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

The insights will help keep employees from leaving and helping grow the company satisfaction overall.
